# Traffic-Sign-Classification

****Project : Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN****

Install : 

This project requires **PYTHON** and the following libraries:
   
   1. Numpy
   2. Pandas
   3. Matplotlib
   4. Tensorflow
   5. Keras

You will also have to need software installed to run and execute a Jupyter notebook.
If you do not have Python then it is highly recommended to **ANACONDA** distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Code :

The template code is provided in the **TrafficSignalRecognition.ipynb** notebook file. The code has been done using **Convolutional Neural Networks**. The dataset(images) is also attached alongside. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

Run :

In order to run the code you will have to do the following steps:

    1. You will have to download the TrafficSignalRecognition.ipynb file and copy paste it in the following path --> **C:\Users\(Your username)**.
    2. Open the jupyter notebook and then open the .ipynb file to access the code.
    3. Run each and every cell in order to run the code one by one.
